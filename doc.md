# Limitations of Auto-Generation from CAD File

## Categorise and label components and fasteners

* 4 Types of Components -> Core, Connecting Component, Frame, Housing

Idea -> Rather than Auto-Generate, have the user label the different types
of components in the CAD file?

## Represent connections of components and fasteners


## Assign disassembly actions to fasteners


## Represent disassembly component identification


## Provide rules for component identification

* SWRL Rules

Junction Block Cover
Conditions:

* EV Battery cover is removed
